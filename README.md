Hello Sentient Beings

Its Frank, I wanna learn how to code and some problems using code. I'm particularly interested in AI. Im learning Python as my first language (since im not counting HTML and CSS since they were a bit too simple). I wanna complete CS50 as well as study from other text-book materials.
